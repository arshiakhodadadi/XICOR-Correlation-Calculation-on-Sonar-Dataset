# XICOR-Correlation-Calculation-on-Sonar-Dataset
🔍 Understanding the Code
Function Definition:
The xicor function computes the Xi correlation between two arrays, X and Y. It includes an option to handle tied values in Y through the ties parameter.

Sorting and Ranking:

The indices of X are sorted based on their values to obtain the order.

If ties is True, the function calculates the number of elements in Y[order] greater than or equal to each element, storing these counts in arrays l and r.

Handling Ties:

For tied values in r, the function introduces randomness to break the ties, ensuring a more accurate computation of the Xi coefficient.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The code reads a dataset from a CSV file using pandas.

It extracts the second column as x and the last column as y for analysis.

Function Invocation:

Finally, the xicor function is called with x, y, and ties=True to compute the Xi correlation coefficient.

📌 Applications of Chatterjee's Xi Correlation
Detecting Non-linear Associations:
Unlike Pearson or Spearman coefficients, Xi can detect non-linear and non-monotonic relationships between variables.

Feature Selection in Machine Learning:
Xi can be used to identify features that have a strong association with the target variable, even if the relationship is complex.

Causal Inference:
Since Xi is asymmetric (i.e., 
𝜉
(
𝑋
,
𝑌
)
≠
𝜉
(
𝑌
,
𝑋
)
ξ(X,Y)

=ξ(Y,X)), it can provide insights into potential causal directions between variables.

Robust Statistical Analysis:
Xi does not assume any specific distribution of the data, making it suitable for robust statistical analyses.
